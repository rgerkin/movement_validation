(a-c) The habituation and growth are shown for 25 young-adult,
hermaphrodite N2s averaged in 1 minute bins. (a) The habituation of the
crawling-wave amplitude is fit with an exponential with time constant t
= 48 minutes (R2 = 0.59). (b) The habituation of the crawling-wave
frequency is fit with an exponential with a time constant t = 19 minutes
(R2 = 0.71). (c) Both length and width are fit with a 1% linear growth
per hour (R2 = 0.92 and 0.76 respectively). (d-e) The means are shown as
vertical lines for positive (solid line) and negative (dashed line)
portions of the histogram. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed with
Bonferroni correction for the 12 tests performed across both panels. (d)
21 N2s from CGC stock (green) are compared to 27 N2s from our lab stock
(gray). The mean and SEM, for the CGC and lab respectively, are: length
= 1162 ± 13µm, 1183 ± 19µm (p = 1); forward speed = 137 ± 14µm/s, 104 ±
12µm/s (p = 0.5); backward speed = 142 ± 15µm/s, 98 ± 11µm/s (p = 0.3);
dorsal foraging = 42 ± 0.6°, 38 ± 0.6° (p = 6x10-3 \*\*); ventral foraging
= 41 ± 0.8°, 39 ± 0.6° (p = 1); exploratory range = 2.7 ± 0.3mm, 1.8 ±
0.2mm (p = 0.2). (e) 43 LSJ1s (orange) are compared to 107 N2s from our
lab stock (gray). The mean and SEM, for the LSJ1 and lab respectively,
are: length = 1049 ± 9µm, 1166 ± 7µm (p = 2x10-13 ); forward speed = 213
± 6µm/s, 106 ± 6µm/s (p = 6x10-14 ); backward speed = 221 ± 6µm/s, 97 ±
10µm/s (p = 2x10-14 ); dorsal foraging = 37 ± 0.5°, 36.9 ± 0.4° (p = 1);
ventral foraging = 36.5 ± 0.3°, 36.5 ± 0.3° (p = 1); exploratory range =
3.3 ± 0.1mm, 2.1 ± 0.1mm (p = 2x10-12\*\*\*\*).
