Supplementary Figure 4: Phenotypic summaries
============================================

![](Supplementary%20Figure%204.gif)

Phenotypic summaries using selected features for subsets of strains.
Colors in the heat maps are used to indicate the q-value for each
feature for the comparison between each of the mutant strains listed on
the right and the N2 reference data. Red values indicate features that
have a significantly higher value in the mutant while blue indicates
significantly lower values. These data have not been clustered to
facilitate finding a gene of interest.
