Supplementary Figure 1: Feature computation
===========================================

![](Supplementary%20Figure%201.gif)

(a) The locations of the body parts used for feature computation: head,
    neck, midbody, hips, and tail. Each body part encompasses 1/6 of the
    worm (measured along the contour and skeleton, independently), save
    for the midbody which is 1/3. The head and tail are further split in
    half to create the head and tail tips, each 1/12 long. (b) The bend
    angle (a) is the difference in tangent angles at each point; or,
    alternatively phrased, the supplementary angle (a) with respect to
    the angle formed by any three consecutive points (ß). The bend angle
    is signed negatively whenever the ventral side is concave within the
    bend (as is the case for the bend shown). (c-f) Methods of
    quantifying worm motion. (c) A simple diagram represents worm
    velocity and the crawling wave. (d) The velocity vector of a body
    part is measured relative to the head-tail axis. The velocity, per
    body part, is the vector of its respective centroid. (e) A crawling
    wave is represented as the sinusoidal wave of the bend angle at its
    associated body part. Note the dorsal-ventral asymmetry both in the
    amplitude and in the wavelength itself. The dotted window encloses a
    waveform used to measure an instantaneous crawling wave. The Fourier
    transform of the waveform reveals a strong peak. This peak defines
    the instantaneous crawling amplitude and frequency. (f) A 25 second
    window of worm motion reveals 2 forward, 3 backward, and roughly 5
    paused events. A short, small peak (between the second and third
    pauses) that may have been forward motion, remains unclassified due
    to ambiguity. (g) Worm foraging is measured from the bend angle
    between the two sections of the head (panel a). The noisy signal
    (black) is smoothed (red) by convolving with a Gaussian. The
    foraging amplitude is defined as the largest foraging bend angle
    measured, prior to crossing 0°. Foraging speed is simply the angular
    speed. Ventral and dorsal foraging is present within the first 1
    second of the trace. The latter half of the trace displays the
    difficulties associated with measuring signal above the noise. At
    nearly 1 second in, the nose appears to quickly cross ventrally
    before rebounding dorsally. Smoothing eliminated the associated sign
    change in amplitude; although, a small, nearly 0° ventral amplitude
    may well be considered noise. (h) The range is defined, per frame,
    as the distance of the worm’s midbody from its final path centroid.
    The central dot displays the final path centroid. The two arrows
    display the range at early and late times within the experiment. (i)
    The locations of worm dwelling are shown as a heatmap. A single
    location of dwelling dominates faint traces of the worm’s path
    during motion.
