Supplementary Figure 5: Clustering for all 305 strains against N2 controls
==========================================================================

![](Supplementary%20Figure%205.gif)

The clustering is shown for all 305 strains alongside the Schafer Lab
N2. 213 features were eliminated due to poor statistical discrimination.
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to convert the remaining
489 features to eigenfeatures, discarding those accounting for the last
1% of variance. Hierarchical clustering was performed using uncentered
correlation and complete linkage. Multiscale resampling was run with
10,000 bootstraps to generate approximately unbiased (AU) p values,
measuring the confidence of tree selection for each branch. For easier
viewing, the dendrogram has been divided into four sections arranged
vertically. The arrangement of each part is indicated by boxes on the
total dendrogram at the top of the page. The horizontal length of each
branch in each partial dendrogram is scaled to its correlation value.
The horizontal branches are color coded to show the AU of the clusters
below them. AU = 99.9% is colored red, AU = 99% orange, AU = 95% yellow,
and all else is black.
