Supplementary Figure 3: Wild type variability
=============================================

![](Supplementary%20Figure%203.gif)

1,218 young-adult N2 hermaphrodites were recorded over 3 years
spontaneously behaving on food. (a) Our lab-stock wild type show
significant differences in hourly and monthly measures at p = 0.05, but
none daily. Kruskal-Wallis, one-way analysis of variance, tests were
performed with Bonferroni correction for 18 tests of 3 groups (hour,
day, and month) by six common measures: length (p-value hour = 4x10-2 \*,
day = 0.6, month = 4x10-9\*\*\*\*), forward speed (p-value hour =
5x10-8\*\*\*\*, day = 1, month = 1x10-4,\*\*\*), foraging amplitude ignoring
the dorsal-ventral orientation (p-value hour = 2x10-7 , day = 0.5, month
= 3x10-8 ), reversal frequency (p-value hour = 8x10-3\*\*, day = 0.3,
month = 1x10-4 \*\*\*), coiling frequency (p-value hour = 1, day = 1, month
= 1), and exploratory range (p-value hour = 2x10-23\*\*\*\*, day = 0.3,
month = 5x10-14*\*\*\*). Each experimental mean is plotted as a black
dot and the mean of means is shown in yellow, SEM in magenta, and
standard deviation in cyan. (b) ß (the probability that a false null
hypothesis will not be rejected, equal to 1 – statistical power) as a
function of the number of worms observed in an experiment. ß is plotted
for cases where the mean difference between the test case and the lab N2
is 2 (red), 1 (orange), 0.5 (green), 0.25 (cyan), and 0.125 (blue)
standard deviations (SD) from the collective N2 data. Approximately, 10
worms discriminate a displacement of 2 SD with over 90% power (gray,
dotted lines parallel to the axes) and 20 worms discriminate 1 SD at
over 80% power (black, dashed lines parallel to the axes). Corresponding
feature labels are presented on the far left, in panel a. Each plotted
value was computed using 10,000 bootstrapped Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

Since all tracked animals were identified as fourth-stage larvae the
night before, the small but significant increase in length during the
day is most likely simply due to age. The monthly variation may be due
to differences in lab temperature or humidity, which can both change
seasonally.
