Objectives:
-----------

1.  This repository should house a test
    [pipeline](https://github.com/MichaelCurrie/open-worm-analysis-toolbox/blob/master/documentation/Processing%20Pipeline.md)
    for the OpenWorm project to run a behavioural phenotyping of its
    virtual worm, using the same statistical tests the Schafer lab used
    on their real worm data.\
    [Overall OpenWorm Milestone:
    \#19](https://github.com/openworm/OpenWorm/issues?milestone=19&state=open)
2.  In achieving goal \#1, this repository will also be an open source
    version of the Schafer Lab's Worm Tracker 2 (WT2) analysis pipeline
    that goes from raw real worm videos to worm measurements detected by
    machine vision, to a selection of calculated worm behavioural
    features like average speed.
3.  Also in achieving goal \#1, we hope to have a system for tracking
    the statistics of hundreds of real and virtual worm strains in a
    database.

### Codebase starting point and real worm data source

The Schafer Lab [1] at Cambridge University has taken thousands of hours
of C. elegans videos ([here is an
example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FAiSgl55p0)), using their
proprietary hardware/software package called Worm Tracker 2 (WT2). The
videos are processed by the WT2 software's image processing to capture
the worm's skeleton and contour over time, in 15-minute segments. This
video metadata is stored in hundreds of experiment files available on
their FTP server. [2]

We are using the WT2 analysis software, written in MATLAB, as a starting
point for our own code development work.

This full codebase is available in the
[SegWorm](https://github.com/openworm/SegWorm) repo.

A revised version of this code (revised by @JimHokanson), also in
MatLab, is available in the
[SegWormMatlabClasses](https://github.com/JimHokanson/SegwormMatlabClasses/)
repo.

This repo, intended to be a full Python translation of the
SegWormMatlabClasses repo, is the only one of the three being actively
worked on.

### Further Documentation

The structure of the HDF5 files is described at a high level starting on
page 183 of Ev Yemeniâ€™s 2011 thesis [3] or in the supplemental material
of his 2013 Nature Methods paper [5]. In [2], for example, there are
23135 frames describing 899.9515 seconds of worm movement (900 seconds
is 15 minutes)

Technical descriptions of the features calculated are [available in
hyperlinked
form](https://github.com/openworm/open-worm-analysis-toolbox/blob/master/documentation/Yemini%20Supplemental%20Data/Schafer%20Lab%20Feature%20Descriptions.md),
in documents adapted from the original Schafer Lab Supplemental
Documentation to [4].

Further documentation of worm movement data is available at
@JimHokanson's
[openworm\_docs](https://github.com/JimHokanson/openworm_docs/tree/master/Projects/Movement)
repo.
